Question 1: What kind of agents are the GoWestAgent and the LeftTurnAgent? Simple reflex agents, model-based reflex
agents, ...? Explain. (Write down your answers in an electronic document that you can submit with your code.)

Both of these agents are simple reflex agents. The GoWestAgent only uses the current precept. It does not remember any
information about the world. This agent goes west until it is obstructed and then stops. Similarly, the LeftTurnAgent
turns left at every opportunity and only uses the current precept to make sure that it can turn left.



Question 2: Do the GoWestAgent and the LeftTurnAgent behave rationally in this kind of environment? (Remember, the
erformance measure is to eat as much food as possible.)

Neither GoWestAgent nor LeftTurnAgent are rational. With rectangular rooms, GoWestAgent will hit the left wall stop and
will eat anymore food. Without any obstacles, LeftTurnAgent will move the pacman in a circle (continuously turning left)
which will eat four food. Both of these agents will not explore the entire room and do not eat all the food.
